# BattleSnake

This is a basic if-else snake written in Python. If you couldn't tell, it's just built up from the starter snake thing, so it'll run if you have all the stuff they do.
Might add it, might not; I'm very lazy.
Anyway, I've used this snake in competition and it is constantly being improved, might also try and do a machine learning snake soon :)
It works pretty ok and I'm proud that everything in it is my idea, my logic, my numbers. However, I should definitely figure out floodfill lol.

Ending the same way as last time,
I am a programer, and I'm going to be an engineer
